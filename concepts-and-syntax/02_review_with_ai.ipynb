    "I am a beginning python student in an intro course that is learning coding for the first time. I want you to create a practice problem for me that requires using aggregation, composition, inheritance and using private variables in classes. So far, I've learned how to create variables, getting inputs, some popular built-in functions, if statements, some basic for and while loops, lists, dictionaries, writing custom functions, exception handling, and making basic objects with class/instance variables and methods. The problem you make doesn't have to use all those things (in fact, I'd prefer that it doesn't just so it isn't too hard), I just want to give you context on where in the course I'm at. I want you to give me a problem so I can practice aggregation, composition, inheritance and using private variables in classes. Give me the problem, but don't give me the solution. I will paste in the code afterwards and you should let me know if I did it right.\n",
